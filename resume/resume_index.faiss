# DSA-X GODMODE++: Ultra-Stealth AI Assistant
# FAISS Index File for Resume Storage
# 
# Implemented by Shwet Raj
# Debug checkpoint: FAISS index initialization and storage
#
# This file serves as a placeholder for the FAISS index
# The actual index will be created and populated at runtime
# No persistent storage - RAM-only operation
#
# Index Configuration:
# - Dimension: 1000 (TF-IDF vectors)
# - Type: IndexFlatL2 (Euclidean distance)
# - Storage: RAM-only, no disk persistence
#
# Usage:
# - Loaded into memory at startup
# - Populated with resume embeddings
# - Used for similarity search
# - Cleared on shutdown (no persistence)
